# Microsoft Edge web platform top developer needs dashboard

As part of our commitment to the web platform, we continuously listen to developer signals and feedback. We leverage what we learn to implement the features that developers need to build great web experiences. We also know that developers need those features, especially those that can't be polyfilled, or which create new architectural opportunities, to be available across all browsers.

This repository contains the source code for a dashboard that represents our view of progress across the web ecosystem towards resolving top developer pain points and closing interoperability gaps.

Access the dashboard at [https://MicrosoftEdge.github.io/TopDeveloperNeeds](https://MicrosoftEdge.github.io/TopDeveloperNeeds).
